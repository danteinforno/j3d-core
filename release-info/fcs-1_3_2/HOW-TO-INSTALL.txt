Instructions for installing Java 3D 1.3.2

Java 3D version 1.3.2 runs on JDK version 1.4.2 and higher.
To install this build, chdir to the "jre" directory within the jdk
and unzip (or unjar) the zip file.  For example, if your JDK is installed
in /usr/java/j2sdk1.5.0, you would install this as follows:

	cd /usr/java/j2sdk1.5.0/jre
	unzip /path-to-extracted-files/j3d-jre-*.zip

You may need to be "root" to do this on Solaris or Linux.
