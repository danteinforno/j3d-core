<p>This project contains the source code
for the core Java&nbsp;3D<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> API
package, <code>javax.media.j3d</code>.<br>
</p>
<p>Related projects include: <a href="https://vecmath.dev.java.net/">vecmath</a>
(the 3D vector math package), <a
 href="https://j3d-core-utils.dev.java.net/">j3d-core-utils</a> (the
Java&nbsp;3D core utilities), and <a
 href="https://j3d-examples.dev.java.net/">j3d-examples</a> (the
Java&nbsp;3D
example programs). The vecmath and j3d-core-utils projects are required
to build j3d-core. Refer to the <a href="build-instr.html">download
and build
instructions</a> for information on downloading and building j3d-core.</p>

Research License (JRL)</a> for non-commercial use. The JRL allows users
to download, build, and modify the source code in the
j3d-core project for research use, subject to the terms of the license.
</p>
<p>Java&nbsp;3D is also licensed for commercial use under a new

allows commercial use of Java&nbsp;3D with or without modification, as
long as compatibility with the entire API Specification is maintained.
This includes passing the TCK tests for Java&nbsp;3D, and retaining the
javax namespace as defined by the JCP.
</p>
<p>
The API specification will continue to evolve as part of the Java
Community Process (JCP). We welcome community participation, and
encourage developers to contribute both bug fixes and new
implementation code to the API. The combination of the JRL and the JDL
was chosen to facilitate this, while ensuring the integrity and
compatibility of the API.<br>

<h3><a name="Downloads"></a>Downloads</h3>
<p>Three types of binary builds are available in the <a
 href="servlets/ProjectDocumentList">Documents
&amp; Files</a>
section of this project on java.net: Release (or FCS) builds;
Experimental (early access) builds; and Daily/Weekly builds. The latest
release build of Java&nbsp;3D v1.3.1 is available. A fairly stable
experimental build, labeled as Java&nbsp;3D v 1.3.2-build4 is now
available. We will set up daily or weekly builds in the near future.<br>

<h3><a name="How_to_Contribute"></a>How to Contribute</h3>
<p>We invite developers to contribute to Java&nbsp;3D. Please refer to
the
<a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/contribute.html">Contributing to
Java&nbsp;3D</a> page in the parent java3d project to learn
how to contribute to this project or any other Java&nbsp;3D-related
project. See the <a href="https://javadesktop.dev.java.net/govern.html">JavaDesktop
Community Governance Guidelines</a> for general guidelines on

<h3><a name="Reporting_Issues"></a>Reporting Issues<br>
</h3>
<p>We have set up the <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue Tracker</a>
in the parent java3d
project
to track issues (bugs, feature requests, etc.) for
Java&nbsp;3D-related
sub-projects. Please use the above link rather than the Issue Tracker
in this j3d-core project. Refer to the <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/#Reporting_Issues">Reporting
Issues</a> section in the parent java3d project for more information.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Feedback_and_Discussion"></a>Feedback and Discussion<br>
</h3>
<p>We have created four Java&nbsp;3D mailing lists in the parent <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/">java3d</a> project:&nbsp;<span
 style="color: blue;">interest 'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>,
<span style="color: blue;">announce 'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>,
<span style="color: blue;">issues 'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>,
and <span style="color: blue;">cvs 'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>
(replace 'at' with @). <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">Click
here to subscribe</a> to any of these lists. The <span
 style="font-style: italic;">interest</span> list is an open mailing
list for
discussing all aspects of Java&nbsp;3D, the reference implementation
for the
Java&nbsp;3D core, vecmath, utilities, example programs, etc. The <span
 style="font-style: italic;">annouce</span> list is a
low-volume moderated mailing list for announcing Java&nbsp;3D-related
news
and information. The <span style="font-style: italic;">issues</span>
list is for automated issues tracking, and the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">cvs</span> list is for automated CVS
change messages (for changes to the parent java3d web pages only).</p>
<p>For those who prefer a forum to a discussion mailing list, we have
created the
<a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectForumView"
 target="_blank">Java&nbsp;3D
forum</a>, hosted as part of the JavaDesktop Community. Messages
posted on the forum are cross-posted to <span style="color: blue;">interest
'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>
and vice-versa.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, each sub-project has its own cvs mailing
list.&nbsp;<a href="servlets/ProjectMailingListList">Click here to
subscribe</a> to this list. The <span style="color: blue;">cvs 'at'
j3d-core.dev.java.net</span>

changes.</p>
<h3><a name="Project_Highlights"></a>Project Highlights</h3>
<p><b>Release project Source code</b> </p>
<p>The current, experimental fork of the of the Java&nbsp;3D source
code is an early access of version 1.3.2. It is
available for download from the CVS repository of this project.<br>
</p>
<p>This source release differs from the the current 1.3.1 release in
the following
ways:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <code>com.sun.j3d.*</code> packages have been split out into
their own project (<a href="https://j3d-core-utils.dev.java.net/">j3d-core-utils</a>).</li>
  <li>Apache Ant is now used to build Java&nbsp;3D<br>
  </li>
  <li>The Headspace AudioEngine has been removed. The JavaSound
AudioEngine, which is not fully functional, is now the only available
AudioDevice<br>
  </li>
  <li>The internal documentation has been cleaned up for
public
consumption (although <span style="font-weight: bold;">much </span>work
is needed on the actual content)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Some minor bug fixes have been incorporated<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The reason the Headspace AudioEngine was removed is that we do not
have
the rights to ship the source code for the native Headspace sound
mixer. Our plan
going forward is to implement an AudioEngine using <a
 href="https://joal.dev.java.net/">JOAL</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java&nbsp;3D 1.3.x bug fixes</span><br>
</p>
<p>We will work with the community to address bugs identified in
Java&nbsp;3D
1.3.1, and will release new versions of Java&nbsp;3D 1.3.x as
needed.
Bug fixes will be immediately available in the CVS source, or from the
weekly builds on this site. We will release official 1.3.x versions no
more often than twice a year.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java&nbsp;3D 1.4</span><br>
</p>
<p>We will file a new JSR (or revive the existing <a
 href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=189" target="_blank">JSR-189</a>)
under the Java
Community Process (JCP) shortly, and form an Expert Group of community
members to
design and implement the next version of the Java&nbsp;3D API. We
envision 1.4
including features such as programmable shaders. Our goal is to
minimize large scale changes to the system in order to deliver 1.4 as
quickly as possible. This initial direction could be changed by the
Expert Group.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java&nbsp;3D 1.5/2.0</span><br>
</p>
<p>The scope of this release will be driven by the JSR Expert Group.
Our initial
thoughts are that this work will include large scale changes to support
features such as extensibility and pluggable renderers.<br>
