<h1>Java&nbsp;3D API version 1.5 Change Log</h1>
<p>Here are the proposed changes for Java&nbsp;3D version 1.5. These
proposed changes are a results of discussion and collaboration with the
Java&nbsp;3D community on java.net (see
<a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net">https://java3d.dev.java.net</a>).
They are already part of daily and periodic stable builds available on
java.net.</p>
<h2>I. Proposed Changes<br>
</h2>
<p>Here is the list of proposed changes for the Java&nbsp;3D 1.5 API:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#NPOT_Textures">Non-power-of-two Textures</a></li>
</ol>
<p>For a complete description of these changes, please see the
proposed API specification (javadoc) for the 1.5 version of the
Java&nbsp;3D API.
</p>
<h3><a name="NPOT_Textures"></a>1. Non-power-of-two Textures</h3>
<p>We propose to add non-power-of-two textures to Java&nbsp;3D 1.5.
Currently, the width, height, and depth of all textures must be an
exact power of two. Most graphics cards now support non-power-of-two
textures, so we propose to allow this in Java 3D. Since not all
graphics drivers support this feature, we will add a new
<code>"textureNonPowerOfTwoAvailable"</code> property to
Canvas3D.queryProperties that will indicate whether or not
non-power-of-two textures are supported. If this
property is set to <code>true</code>, then non-power-of-two textures
are rendered normally. If this property is set to <code>false</code>,
then the graphics driver or card does not support non-power-of-two
textures; texture mapping will be disabled if non-power-of-two
textures are rendered on a Canvas3D that doesn't support them.<br>
