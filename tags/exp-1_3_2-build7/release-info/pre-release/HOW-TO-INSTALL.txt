This interrim build runs on JDK version 1.4.2 and higher.
To install this build, chdir to the "jre" directory within the jdk
and unjar (or unzip) the jar file.  For example, if your JDK is installed
in /usr/java/j2sdk1.5.0, you would install this as follows:

	cd /usr/java/j2sdk1.5.0/jre
	jar xvf /path-to-downloaded-jar-file.jar

You may need to be "root" to do this on Solaris or Linux.
