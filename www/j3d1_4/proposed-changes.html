<h2>Proposed Java&nbsp;3D<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 1.4 API
Changes</h2>
<p>This page highlights the proposed changes to the 1.4 version of the
Java&nbsp;3D<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> API. For a list of new
classes methods, etc., see the <a href="api-changes.html">List of
Proposed Java&nbsp;3D 1.4 API
Changes</a>. Click
<a href="http://javadesktop.org/java3d/javadoc/1.4.0-latest/index.html">here</a>
for the
<a href="http://javadesktop.org/java3d/javadoc/1.4.0-latest/index.html">latest
javadocs for the proposed 1.4 API</a> (built from the dev-1_4 branch).<br>
</p>
<h3>I. High Priority Features</h3>
<p>This list of high priority features will almost certainly make it
into the 1.4 API.
</p>
<h4>1. Programmable shaders</h4>
<p>The addition of shaders to the Java&nbsp;3D API is the primary focus
for the 1.4. For more information see the <a href="shaders.html">Programmable
Shaders in Java&nbsp;3D 1.4</a> page.
