  <title>The Java 3D API Core</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This project contains the source code
for the core Java&nbsp;3D API
package, <code>javax.media.j3d</code>.<br>
</p>
<p>Related projects include: <a href="http://vecmath.dev.java.net/">vecmath</a>
(the 3D vector math package), <a
 href="http://j3d-core-utils.dev.java.net/">j3d-core-utils</a> (the
Java&nbsp;3D core utilities), and <a
 href="http://j3d-examples.dev.java.net/">j3d-examples</a> (the
Java&nbsp;3D
example programs). The vecmath and j3d-core-utils projects are required
to build j3d-core. Refer to the <a href="build-instr.html">download
and build
instructions</a> for information on downloading and building j3d-core.</p>
<h3>License</h3>
<p>The source code for the core Java&nbsp;3D API reference
implementation is licensed under terms that are yet to be disclosed.
Until such time as these terms are disclosed, you may not do anything
at all with the source code in this CVS repository.<br>
</p>
<p>The API specification will continue to evolve as part of the
<a href="http://jcp.org/">Java Community Process (JCP)</a>.
We welcome community participation, and encourage developers to
contribute both bug fixes and new implementation code to the API.
The terms under which we will license this source code will facilitate
this, while ensuring that the API is not fragmented with incompatible
versions being released.<br>
</p>
<h3>Project highlights</h3>
<p><b>Release project Source code</b> </p>
<p>The current, experimental fork of the of the Java&nbsp;3D source
code is an early access of version 1.3.2. It is
available for download from the CVS repository of this project.<br>
</p>
<p>This source release differs from the the current 1.3.1 release in
the following
ways:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <code>com.sun.j3d.*</code> packages have been split out into
their own project (<a href="http://j3d-core-utils.dev.java.net/">j3d-core-utils</a>).</li>
  <li>Apache Ant is now used to build Java&nbsp;3D<br>
  </li>
  <li>The Headspace AudioEngine has been removed. The JavaSound
AudioEngine, which is not fully functional, is now the only available
AudioDevice<br>
  </li>
  <li>The internal documentation has been cleaned up for
public
consumption (although <span style="font-weight: bold;">much </span>work
is needed on the actual content)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Some minor bug fixes have been incorporated [TODO: list fixed
bugs]</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason the Headspace AudioEngine was removed is that we do not
have
the rights to ship the source code for the native Headspace sound
mixer. Our plan
going forward is to implement an AudioEngine using <a
 href="http://joal.dev.java.net/">JOAL</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java&nbsp;3D 1.3.x bug fixes</span><br>
</p>
<p>We will work with the community to address bugs identified in
Java&nbsp;3D
1.3.1, and will release new versions of Java&nbsp;3D 1.3.x as
needed.
Bug fixes will be immediately available in the CVS source, or from the
weekly builds on this site. We will release official 1.3.x versions no
more often than twice a year.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java&nbsp;3D 1.4</span><br>
</p>
<p>We will file a new JSR (or revive the existing <a
 href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=189">JSR-189</a>) under the Java
Community Process (JCP) shortly, and form an Expert Group of community
members to
design and implement the next version of the Java&nbsp;3D API. We
envision 1.4
including features such as programmable shaders. Our goal is to
minimize large scale changes to the system in order to deliver 1.4 as
quickly as possible. This initial direction could be changed by the
Expert Group.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java&nbsp;3D 1.5/2.0</span><br>
</p>
<p>The scope of this release will be driven by the JSR Expert Group.
Our initial
thoughts are that this work will include large scale changes to support
features such as extensibility and pluggable renderers.<br>

</ul>
<h3>How to Contribute</h3>
<p>Anyone who wants to contribute source code, even in the form of
e-mailed bug fixes,
must have a signed contributor agreement [TODO link] on file. The
Java&nbsp;3D
team regrets that we are unable to even look at submitted bug fixes
unless this author
has the
contributor agreement on file. This may seems harsh, but it is a policy
designed to protect the project from patent infringement and copyright
issues. We encourage all developers to download the agreement [TODO
link], sign it, and
fax it
to the number indicated [TODO link]. Then you are more than welcome to
send in fixes for your favorite bugs!<br>
</p>
<p>We invite anyone to be a project <span style="font-style: italic;">observer</span>.
As the community matures and contributors demonstrate their
familiarity
with the API internals they will be invited to join the project as a
<span style="font-style: italic;">developer</span> with full CVS commit
privilege. The last thing we want is
lots of people hacking on the source in the central repository and
destabilizing the API, so we will be taking a cautious approach.<br>
</p>
<p>The <a href="http://jcp.org/">Java Community Process</a> (JCP) also
has a significant impact on how people can
contribute to the project. Although the source of the API is available,
and we actively encourage the community to contribute to it's
development, the API itself (that is, the public and protected classes,
interfaces, methods, fields, and so forth in the <code>javax.media.j3d</code>
and <code>javax.vecmath</code> packages) are
controlled by the JCP and can not be freely modified.
Modifications to the API will be created within the Java&nbsp;3D JSR's
by an Expert Group of JCP members. A call for experts will be
made once this process is launched.
