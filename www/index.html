<p>This project contains the source code
for the core Java&nbsp;3D<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> API
package, <code>javax.media.j3d</code>.<br>
</p>
<p>Related projects include: <a href="https://vecmath.dev.java.net/">vecmath</a>
(the 3D vector math package), <a
 href="https://j3d-core-utils.dev.java.net/">j3d-core-utils</a> (the
Java&nbsp;3D core utilities), and <a
 href="https://j3d-examples.dev.java.net/">j3d-examples</a> (the
Java&nbsp;3D
example programs). The vecmath and j3d-core-utils projects are required
to build j3d-core. Refer to the <a href="build-instr.html">download
and build
instructions</a> for information on downloading and building j3d-core.</p>

<p>Java&nbsp;3D is also licensed for commercial use under a new

allows commercial use of Java&nbsp;3D with or without modification, as
long as compatibility with the entire API Specification is maintained.
This includes passing the TCK tests for Java&nbsp;3D, and retaining the
javax namespace as defined by the JCP.
</p>
<p>
The API specification will continue to evolve as part of the Java
Community Process (JCP). We welcome community participation, and
encourage developers to contribute both bug fixes and new
implementation code to the API. The combination of the JRL and the JDL
was chosen to facilitate this, while ensuring the integrity and
compatibility of the API.<br>

<h3><a name="Downloads"></a>Downloads</h3>
<p>Three types of Java&nbsp;3D <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html">binary builds</a>
are available on java.net: Release (or FCS) builds;
Stable (experimental, early access) builds; and Daily builds. The
latest
release build of Java&nbsp;3D v1.3.1 is available. Stable
builds of Java&nbsp;3D 1.3.2 (beta) are available.
Daily builds of both 1.3.2 and 1.4.0 are now available.<br>
</p>
<p>The javadoc for the beta2 build of Java&nbsp;3D v 1.3.2 can be found
<a href="http://javadesktop.org/java3d/javadoc/1.3.2-beta2/index.html">here</a>.

<p>We invite developers to contribute to Java&nbsp;3D. Please refer to
the
<a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/contribute.html">Contributing to
Java&nbsp;3D</a> page in the parent java3d project to learn
how to contribute to this project or any other Java&nbsp;3D-related
project. See the <a href="https://javadesktop.dev.java.net/govern.html">JavaDesktop
Community Governance Guidelines</a> for general guidelines on

<h3><a name="Reporting_Issues"></a>Reporting Issues<br>
</h3>
<p>We have set up the <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue Tracker</a>
in the parent java3d
project
to track issues (bugs, feature requests, etc.) for
Java&nbsp;3D-related
sub-projects. Please use the above link rather than the Issue Tracker
in this j3d-core project. Refer to the <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/#Reporting_Issues">Reporting
Issues</a> section in the parent java3d project for more information.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Feedback_and_Discussion"></a>Feedback and Discussion<br>
</h3>
<p>We have created four Java&nbsp;3D mailing lists in the parent <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/">java3d</a> project:&nbsp;<span
 style="color: blue;">interest 'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>,
<span style="color: blue;">announce 'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>,
<span style="color: blue;">issues 'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>,
and <span style="color: blue;">cvs 'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>
(replace 'at' with @). <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">Click
here to subscribe</a> to any of these lists. The <span
 style="font-style: italic;">interest</span> list is an open mailing
list for
discussing all aspects of Java&nbsp;3D, the reference implementation
for the
Java&nbsp;3D core, vecmath, utilities, example programs, etc. The <span
 style="font-style: italic;">annouce</span> list is a
low-volume moderated mailing list for announcing Java&nbsp;3D-related
news
and information. The <span style="font-style: italic;">issues</span>
list is for automated issues tracking, and the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">cvs</span> list is for automated CVS
change messages (for changes to the parent java3d web pages only).</p>
<p>For those who prefer a forum to a discussion mailing list, we have
created the
<a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectForumView"
 target="_blank">Java&nbsp;3D
forum</a>, hosted as part of the JavaDesktop Community. Messages
posted on the forum are cross-posted to <span style="color: blue;">interest
'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>
and vice-versa.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, each sub-project has its own cvs mailing
list.&nbsp;<a href="servlets/ProjectMailingListList">Click here to
subscribe</a> to this list. The <span style="color: blue;">cvs 'at'
j3d-core.dev.java.net</span>
list is for automated CVS change messages and discussion of those
changes.</p>
<h3><a name="Project_Highlights"></a>Project Highlights</h3>
<p><b>Release project Source code</b> </p>
<p>The Java&nbsp;3D source
code is available for download from the CVS repository of this project.
The trunk of the CVS repository is a stable (pre-fcs) version of
Java&nbsp;3D 1.3.2. A Java&nbsp;3D 1.4 development branch, <code>dev-1_4</code>,
is also available in the CVS repository. For a
description of the CVS tags used in this project, please refer to <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/cvs-tags.html">"Using CVS Tags in
Java&nbsp;3D Projects"</a>. Daily builds for both <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html#Daily_builds_1.3.2">1.3.2</a>
and <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/binary-builds.html#Daily_builds_1.4.0">1.4.0</a>
are
available and are built from the CVS source trees.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java&nbsp;3D 1.3.2</span><br>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The 1.3.2 version of Java&nbsp;3D on java.net differs from the 1.3.1
release in
the following ways:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <code>com.sun.j3d.*</code> packages have been split out into
their own project (<a href="https://j3d-core-utils.dev.java.net/">j3d-core-utils</a>).</li>
  <li>Apache Ant is now used to build Java&nbsp;3D<br>
  </li>
  <li>The Headspace AudioEngine has been removed. The JavaSound
AudioEngine, which is not fully functional, is now the only available
AudioDevice. It is disabled by default.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Many bug fixes have been incorporated<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The reason the Headspace AudioEngine was removed is that we do not
have
the rights to ship the source code for the native Headspace sound
mixer. Our plan
going forward is to enourage the development community to implement an
AudioEngine using <a href="https://joal.dev.java.net/">JOAL</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java&nbsp;3D 1.4</span><br>
</p>
<p>A description of the set of <a href="j3d1_4/proposed-changes.html">proposed
Java&nbsp;3D
1.4 API changes</a> is now available. The main focus of the proposed
1.4
API is&nbsp; the addition of <a href="j3d1_4/shaders.html">programmable
shaders</a>. Our goal is to
minimize large scale changes to the system in order to deliver 1.4 as
quickly as possible. We encourage members of the development community
to review this proposed set of changes and provide feedback. We also
hope that community members will help us design and implement the 1.4
version of the Java&nbsp;3D API.<br>
</p>
<p>Once the majority of the API changes are decided upon for
Java&nbsp;3D 1.4, we will file
a new JSR (or revive the existing <a
 href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=189" target="_blank">JSR-189</a>)
under the Java
Community Process (JCP). At this time, we don't anticipate forming a
JCP Expert Group, since we will already have reviewed the API publicly
in the java.net community.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java&nbsp;3D 1.5/2.0</span><br>
</p>
<p>The scope of this release will be driven by the level of interest
and community support that we get.
Our initial
thoughts are that this work will include large scale changes to support
features such as extensibility and pluggable renderers. Click the
following link for a <a
 href="j3d1_4/proposed-changes.html#Future_Features">list of
possible 1.5/2.0 features</a>.<br>

<h3><a name="Project_Suggestions"></a>Project Suggestions</h3>
<p>The main areas in j3d-core for which we need help from the community
are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bug fixes (see the <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">list of open
issues</a>)</li>
  <li>Testing and example programs for programmable shaders</li>
</ul>
