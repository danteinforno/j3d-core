  <title>The Java 3D API Core</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This project contains the source code
for the core Java&nbsp;3D API
package, <code>javax.media.j3d</code>.<br>
</p>
<p>Related projects include: <a href="http://vecmath.dev.java.net/">vecmath</a>
(the 3D vector math package), <a
 href="http://j3d-core-utils.dev.java.net/">j3d-core-utils</a> (the
Java&nbsp;3D core utilities), and <a
 href="http://j3d-examples.dev.java.net/">j3d-examples</a> (the
Java&nbsp;3D
example programs). The vecmath and j3d-core-utils projects are required
to build j3d-core. Refer to the <a href="../README-build.html">build
instructions</a> for
more information.</p>
<h3>License</h3>
<p>The source code for the core Java&nbsp;3D API reference
implementation is available for research use
under the
Java Research License (JRL) [TODO: license link].
It is also available for commercial use
under the Java Distribution License (JDL) [TODO: license link].
The API specification will continue to evolve as part of the Java
Community Process (JCP). We welcome community
participation, and encourage developers to
contribute both bug fixes and
new implementation code to the API. The JRL and JDL licenses were
chosen to
facilitate this, while ensuring that the API is not fragmented with
incompatible versions being released.<br>
</p>
<h3>Project highlights</h3>
<p><b>Release project Source code</b> </p>
<p>This release of the Java&nbsp;3D source code based on Java&nbsp;3D
1.3.1 is
available for download from the CVS repository of this project. <br>
</p>
<p>This source release differs from the 1.3.1 release in the following
ways:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Java&nbsp;3D internal documentation has been upgraded for
public
consumption</li>
  <li>Apache Ant is now used to build Java&nbsp;3D<br>
  </li>
  <li>The Headspace AudioEngine has been removed. The JavaSound
AudioEngine, which is not fully functional, is now the only available
AudioDevice<br>
  </li>
  <li>Some minor bug fixes have been incorporated [TODO: list fixed
bugs]</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason the Headspace AudioEngine was removed is that we do not
have
the rights to ship the source code for the native Headspace sound
mixer. Our plan
going forward is to implement an AudioEngine using <a
 href="http://joal.dev.java.net/">JOAL</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java&nbsp;3D 1.3.x bug fixes</span><br>
</p>
<p>We will work with the community to address bugs identified in
Java&nbsp;3D
1.3.1 and the will release new versions of Java&nbsp;3D 1.3.x as
needed.
Bugfixes will be immediately available in the cvs source, or from the
weekly builds on this site. We will release official 1.3.x versions no
more often than twice a year.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java&nbsp;3D 1.4</span><br>
</p>
<p>We will form a JSR and work with the community to
design and implement the next release of Java&nbsp;3D. We envision 1.4
including features such a programmable shaders. Our current aim is to
minimize large scale changes to the system in order to deliver 1.4 as
quickly as possible. This initial direction may be changed by the JSR.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Java&nbsp;3D 1.5/2.0</span><br>
</p>
<p>The scope of this release will be driven by the JSR. Our initial
thoughts are that this work will include large scale changes to support
features such as extensibility and pluggable renderers.<br>

<h3><a name="Project_Suggestions"></a>Project Suggestions</h3>
<p>Here are some project ideas for the j3d-core project. Please see the
<a href="http://j3d-core-utils.dev.java.net/#Project_Suggestions">Project
Suggestions</a> in the <a href="http://j3d-core-utils.dev.java.net/">j3d-core-utils</a>
project for more ideas.</p>
<ul>
  <li>DirectX build environment for MinGW (using gcc)<br>
  </li>
  <li>DirectX 9 port</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Contribute</h3>
<p>[TODO: kcr: rewrite (and run spell check)]</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to contribute source code, even e-mailed bug fixes,
must have a signed contributor agreement on file. The Java&nbsp;3D
team is unable to even look at submitted bug fixes unless this author
has the
contributor agreement on file. This may seems harsh, but it is a policy
designed to protect the project from patent infringement, etc.<br>
</p>
<p>We encourage all developers to download the agreement, sign it, and
fax it
to the number indicated [TODO link]. Then you are more than welcome to
send in fixes for your favorite bugs!<br>
</p>
<p>As the community matures and contributors demonstrate their
familiarity
with the API internals they will be invited to join the project as a
developer with full CVS commit privilege. The last thing we want is
lots of people hacking on the source in the central repository and
destabilizing the API so we will be taking a cautious approach. We are
not intending that Sun is the only organization with the rights to
grant developer privilege, we would like to form a governance board
with community members which will assume this mantel and help guide the
project.<br>
</p>
<p>The JCP process also has a significant impact on how people can
contribute to the project. Although the source of the API is available,
and we actively encourage the community to contribute to it's
development, the API itself (javax.media.j3d.* and javax.vecmath.*) are
controlled by the JCP process and can not be freely modified.
Modifications to the API will be created within the Java&nbsp;3D JSR's
by a
group of JSR members. A call for nominations for JSR members will be
made once this process is kicked off.
